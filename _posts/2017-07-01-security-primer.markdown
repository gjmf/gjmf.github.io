Summary

This is what I recommend for personal electronic security in the US in 2017.

Use the one best product for a particular function,

* Phone: iPhone
* Desktop or laptop: Mac
* Email: Gmail
* Web browser: Chrome with [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) ad-blocking
* Evaluate each for possible replacement every 2-3 years,
* Enable automatic software updates,
* Use web-based services (do use Google Drive or Office365) rather than locally-installed software (don’t use Microsoft Office) whenever feasible,
* Uninstall all Adobe software if possible,
  * (At least, uninstall Flash and Acrobat.)
* Use ad-blockers,
  * (Ublock Origin on Chrome, and [Purify](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/purify-block-ads-tracking./id1030156203?mt=8) on iPhone)
* Use junk call screening,
  * ([Nomorobo](https://www.nomorobo.com/))
* Use multi-factor (AKA two-factor) authentication everywhere possible - especially at important service providers,
  * (such as a passphrase and SMS verification)
  * (note: SMS verification is inadequate if you’re targeted by resourceful attackers. Instead, use [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447) or a [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/).)
* Use a password manager,
  * ([1Password](https://1password.com/))
* Back up your data,
  * ([Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/), and keep a paper copy of critical passwords in a sealed envelope in a home safe, or your credit union’s safe deposit box)
* Be skeptical when you receive alarming messages about money and passwords,
  * ([How to avoid social engineering and phishing attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014). See also [this guide](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-avoid-phishing-attacks).)
* And always ensure your software is up to date.
