        Howdy! I'm Graham Freeman. I'm a SuperNerdDad in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley,_California">Berkeley, California</a>. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%E2%88%9208:00">UTC-0800</a>)
        </p>
<h2 class="page-heading">Professional</h2>
        <p>
        Through my company <a href="https://nerdventures.com/">NerdVentures</a>, I provide excellent IT services to nice folks who do good work.
        </p>
        <p>
        As of January 02016, I'd love to join a capable team of friendly folks on a worthwhile mission, so long as my schedule remains compatible with responsible fatherhood. :)

        Current projects that I'm particularly excited about:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Text-message-based customer support system, with CRM integrations.</b> An SMS-XMPP (Jabber) gateway on Google Compute Engine + Twilio, with tie-ins to Helpscout and Highrise, so as to provide customer support with multiple 
customer support agents presenting a cohesive and unified customer-facing interface - all at a cost of less than $20/month.</li>
        <li><b>Adding photovoltaics to fast, reliable, and inexpensive internet and intranet links.</b> Several 700Mbps roofmount wireless network links, using Ubiquiti AirFiber 24GHz, for fast internet uplinks and to extend a company's network from one building to 
another.  Another 1Gbps link deployment currently in progress, using Siklu 80GHz gear.</li>
            <li><b>Salesforce dev/QA email redirect solution</b> to 100% reliably redirect emails in dev/QA sandboxes to QA & Dev teams instead of actual customers.  Back-end a mixture of AWS 
Lambda, AWS CloudWatch, DigitalOcean, Mailgun, and of course PagerDuty.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Previously, from 02011-02015, I was technical lead in the areas of systems, networking, and information security for a multi-national solar company. My work was called out by a major investor as a significant factor in their decision to invest.  I left in early 02015 in order to live a more balanced life.</p>
<h3 class="page-heading">Personal</h3>
        <p>
        Most importantly, I'm a doting family man, and I have a strong interest in engaging in the world around me.  I'm especially fond of e-bikes, solar power, sea kayaking, and photography.
