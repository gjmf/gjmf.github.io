        <p>
	I work in information security engineering at a large solar energy company. Previously, I worked in similar roles at the University of California and at Stanford University School of Medicine.
	</p>
	<p>
        Through my past consulting work, I've provided excellent IT infrastructure for nice folksÂ who do good work.
        </p>
        <p>
        From 2011-2015, I was a technical lead in the areas of systems, networking, and information security at Sungevity, a multi-national solar energy company. My work was called out by a major investor as a significant factor in their decision to invest. After I left, the co-founding CEO wrote this of my work:
        </p>
<br />
<blockquote>
Graham is a real talent. He demonstrated the rare gift of mixing technical leadership with organizational leadership and people skills. His personable style, hard-work ethic, high-integrity, and passion for his role set him out as a gifted member of the team - combining his technical expertise (first class) with passion and zeal for the mission at Sungevity. I strongly recommend Graham for future roles in high-growth, challenging technical environments and roles that need the combination of technical and business skills.
<br />
-- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/birchy/">Andrew Birch</a>, Co-Founder & CEO, Sungevity, May 2017

	<p>
	Prior to that, I co-founded and helped run several cooperatives and public-benefit organizations.

        <p>
        Most importantly, I'm a doting dad, and I have a strong interest in engaging in the world around me.  I'm especially fond of intentional community, e-bikes, solar power, sea kayaking, and photography.

	[1] There is a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9180887">well-reasoned debate</a> in which at least one brilliant infosec mind <a href="https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/01/15/against-dnssec/">makes a powerful case</a> against the use of DNSSEC. By using DNSSEC on my personal portfolio, I intend only to demonstrate my competence in its use, and suggest that it can be worth using under the right circumstances (with an appropriate threat model). I respect the arguments against the use of DNSSEC, and factor them in to my decisionmaking process.
